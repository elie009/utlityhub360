## 💡 1. Definition

**Your Disposable Amount** is the money left after paying all your fixed and variable expenses.

It's what you can spend freely, save, or allocate to goals.

**Why It Matters:**
- ✅ Know exactly how much you can save or spend
- ✅ Track if you're living within your means
- ✅ Plan for emergencies and future goals
- ✅ Identify areas to cut costs
- ✅ Build financial security

---

## ⚙️ 2. Formula

### Basic Formula

```
Disposable Amount = Total Income - (Total Fixed Expenses + Total Variable Expenses)
```

**Where:**
- **Total Income** = All earnings (salary, bonuses, freelance, etc.)
- **Total Fixed Expenses** = Rent, loans, insurance, subscriptions, etc.
- **Total Variable Expenses** = Utilities, groceries, fuel, entertainment, etc.

**For the Simple API (`/api/Dashboard/summary`):**
```
Remaining Amount = Total Income - Total Expenses - Total Savings

Where:
├── Total Income       = Sum of all active income sources (monthly)
├── Total Expenses     = Bills + Loans
├── Total Savings      = Savings deposits this month
└── Remaining Amount   = What's left for discretionary use
```

---

## 🧮 3. Step-by-Step Computation Example

### Step 1 — List Your Monthly Income

| Source | Amount ($) |
|--------|-----------|
| Salary | 45,000 |
| Freelance | 5,000 |
| **Total Income** | **50,000** |

```
Total Income = 45,000 + 5,000 = $50,000
```

---

### Step 2 — List Your Fixed Expenses

| Fixed Expense | Amount ($) |
|---------------|-----------|
| Rent | 12,000 |
| Loan Payment | 4,000 |
| Internet | 1,500 |
| Insurance | 2,000 |
| **Total Fixed Expenses** | **19,500** |

```
Total Fixed = $19,500
```

---

### Step 3 — List Your Variable Expenses

**(Use weekly → monthly conversion for accuracy)**

| Variable Expense | Weekly Avg ($) | Monthly Estimate (×4.33) | Monthly Total ($) |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Groceries | 1,800 | 1,800 × 4.33 | 7,794 |
| Transportation | 700 | 700 × 4.33 | 3,031 |
| Dining | 500 | 500 × 4.33 | 2,165 |
| **Total Variable** | | | **12,990** |

```
Total Variable = 12,990
```

**Weekly to Monthly Conversion:**
```
Weekly Amount × 4.33 = Monthly Amount
(52 weeks ÷ 12 months = 4.33)
```

---

### Step 4 — Compute Disposable Amount

```
Disposable Amount = 50,000 - (19,500 + 12,990)
Disposable Amount = 50,000 - 32,490 = $17,510
```

```

╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**✅ Your Disposable Amount = $17,510**

This means you have **$17,510** left after all obligations — for savings, emergency funds, or investments.

---

## 🧩 4. (Optional) Add Savings Goals or Investment Allocation

If you plan to set aside savings or investments, update formula:

```
Net Disposable = Disposable Amount - (Target Savings + Investment)
```

### Example:

- **Target Savings** = $5,000
- **Investment** = $2,000

```
Net Disposable = 17,510 - (5,000 + 2,000) = $10,510
```

```

## 🧠 5. Formula Summary for System

### System Pseudocode

```javascript
// Get total income
total_income = sum(income_sources);

// Get fixed expenses
fixed_expenses = sum(fixed_expenses);

// Get variable expenses
// If tracking weekly expenses, convert to monthly
variable_expenses = sum(variable_expenses);
if (expense_frequency === 'WEEKLY') {
    variable_expenses = variable_expenses * 4.33;
}

// Calculate disposable amount
disposable_amount = total_income - (fixed_expenses + variable_expenses);

// Optional: Calculate net disposable
net_disposable = disposable_amount - (target_savings + investment);
```

### Implementation Formula

```csharp
// C# Implementation
decimal totalIncome = incomeSources.Sum(i => i.MonthlyAmount);
decimal totalFixed = bills.Sum(b => b.Amount) + loans.Sum(l => l.MonthlyPayment);
decimal totalVariable = variableExpenses.Sum(v => v.Amount);

decimal disposableAmount = totalIncome - (totalFixed + totalVariable);

// With savings goals
decimal netDisposable = disposableAmount - (targetSavings + investmentAllocation);
```

### Simple API Formula

```csharp
// For GET /api/Dashboard/summary
decimal totalIncome = incomeSources.Sum(i => i.MonthlyAmount);
decimal totalBills = bills.Sum(b => b.Amount);
decimal totalLoans = loans.Sum(l => l.MonthlyPayment);
decimal totalExpenses = totalBills + totalLoans;
decimal totalSavings = savingsTransactions.Sum(st => st.Amount);

decimal remainingAmount = totalIncome - totalExpenses - totalSavings;
```

### Animation Guidelines

```javascript
// Smooth number counting animation
function animateValue(start, end, duration) {
  let startTime = null;
  
  function animation(currentTime) {
    if (!startTime) startTime = currentTime;
    const timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime;
    const progress = Math.min(timeElapsed / duration, 1);
    
    const value = Math.floor(progress * (end - start) + start);
    element.textContent = formatCurrency(value);
    
    if (progress < 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animation);
    }
  }
  
  requestAnimationFrame(animation);
}

// Usage: Animate disposable amount
animateValue(0, 19511, 1500); // 1.5 seconds
```

## 🎓 Formula Reference

### Income Frequency Conversions
```
WEEKLY to MONTHLY:     Amount × 4.33
BI_WEEKLY to MONTHLY:  Amount × 2.17
QUARTERLY to MONTHLY:  Amount ÷ 3
ANNUALLY to MONTHLY:   Amount ÷ 12
```

### Percentage Calculations
```
Disposable %:   (Disposable ÷ Income) × 100
Category %:     (Category Total ÷ Total Variable) × 100
Savings Rate:   (Savings ÷ Income) × 100
Change %:       ((New - Old) ÷ Old) × 100
```

### Health Thresholds
```
Disposable > 20% of Income:  ✅ HEALTHY
Disposable 10-20% of Income: ⚠️ WARNING
Disposable < 10% of Income:  🚨 CRITICAL

Variable < 30% of Income:    ✅ GOOD
Variable 30-40% of Income:   ⚠️ MONITOR
Variable > 40% of Income:    🚨 TOO HIGH

Loans < 25% of Income:       ✅ MANAGEABLE
Loans 25-35% of Income:      ⚠️ HIGH
Loans > 35% of Income:       🚨 EXCESSIVE
